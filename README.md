# **DBSCAN Clustering Implementation for SMLM Analysis**

## **Overview**  
This repository contains an implementation of the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm, designed for clustering analysis in **Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) datasets**. The purpose of this project is to enhance molecular cluster detection while optimizing parameter selection and visualization.

This implementation is based on the original **DBSCAN formulation by Ester et al. (1996)** and is modified from an open-source implementation by **Hahsler et al. (2019)**, available [here](https://github.com/mhahsler/dbscan). The code has been adapted to improve **parameter exploration, visualization, and result summarization** to better support SMLM data analysis.

## **Features & Code Highlights**  

- **Data Scaling:** Ensures all features are standardized, improving distance-based clustering performance.  
- **k-NN Distance Plot:** Assists in selecting an appropriate `eps` value for DBSCAN.  
- **Nested Parameter Search:**  
  - Iterates through multiple combinations of `eps` and `minPts` to systematically explore parameter space.  
  - Stores results for further analysis.  
- **Result Summarization:**  
  - Aggregates results into a structured dataframe.  
  - Saves output to a CSV file for external use.  
- **Visualization Tools:**  
  - **Heatmaps** showing the effect of `eps` and `minPts` on the number of detected clusters.  
  - **Scatter plots** illustrating relationships between parameters, noise points, and clusters.  
  - **Cluster visualization plots** for selected parameter combinations.

## **Package Installation**  

### **Requirements:**  
This project is implemented in **R** and requires the following R packages:  
- **[`dbscan`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dbscan)** – Implements the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in R.  
- **[`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)** – Used for visualizing clustering results.  
- **[`readr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readr)** – Enables efficient data handling and CSV file operations.

You can install them using the following command:

```r
install.packages(c("dbscan", "ggplot2", "readr"))
```

## **How to Use**  

### **1. Prepare Your Data**  
- Replace the file path in `DBSCAN_WORKING_COPY.R` with your dataset.  
- Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and cleaned before running the algorithm.  
- If testing against benchmark datasets, **publicly available datasets from Nieves et al. (2023)** can be used. These datasets provide real-world and simulated clustering scenarios for evaluating algorithm performance.  
- The datasets are available at:  
  [https://github.com/DJ-Nieves/ARI-and-IoU-cluster-analysis-evaluation](https://github.com/DJ-Nieves/ARI-and-IoU-cluster-analysis-evaluation).  

### **2. Adjust Parameters**  
- Modify `eps_values` and `minPts_values` in the script to match your dataset’s expected density.  

### **3. Run the Script**  
- Execute `DBSCAN_WORKING_COPY.R` in **RStudio** or a compatible **R environment**.  

### **4. Analyze the Results**  
- Check the **heatmaps and scatter plots** to understand how parameter choices impact clustering.  
- Use the saved **CSV summary file** for further analysis.  
- Visualize the identified clusters using the **cluster visualization plots** generated by the script.  
- Compare the clustering results against expected molecular structures to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm.
